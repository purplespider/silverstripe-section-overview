# Section Overview Page

## Introduction

Ever had a top level page, with several subpages, and no content to put on the top level page?

Well this page type automatically provides an overview of each of this page's child pages: Title, Summary, Link.

By default the summary is grabbed from a page's Content field, but this module automatically adds an extra "Summary Text" field to subpages, so that the page's summary text can be overridden if necessary.
